[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6+-blue.svg)](https://github.com/rpiRobotics/abb_motion_program_exec)

`fanuc_motion_program_exec` provides a simple way to download and run a sequence of `MoveJ`, `MoveL`, `MoveC` commands on an FANUC R-30iB robot controller. This program is intended to be a proof of concept for more sophisticated controller interfaces. Multi-move control of two robots is also supported.

## Prerequisite

### Robot Controller

You will need a physical FANUC robot or `RoboGuide`, the FANUC robot simulation. The following robot options are required.

- KAREL (R632)
- Ascii Program Loader (R790)
- PC Interface (R641)

For dual robot arms, the following additional option is required.

- Multi-group (J686)
- Coordinated Motion (J601)

#### Others
- The module utilize register number 80~83. Please leave them as 0 before using the module and don't modify the register.

## Installation on Robots

### RoboGuide

The installation of modulel in RoboGuide includes setting up a cell and loading necessary scripts.

- Single Robot: See [robot_setup.md](https://github.com/eric565648/fanuc_motion_program_exec/blob/main/doc/robot_setup.md)
- Multi Robot: See [multi_robot_setup.md](https://github.com/eric565648/fanuc_motion_program_exec/blob/main/doc/multi_robot_setup.md)
- Multi Robot with Coordinated Motion [multi_robot_coord_setup.md](https://github.com/eric565648/fanuc_motion_program_exec/blob/main/doc/multi_robot_coord_setup.md)

### Real Robot

For the real robot, follow the same procedure as in RoboGuide. In addition, you will need to insert an extra USB flash drive to the robot controller.

## Installation of Python Module

The `fanuc_motion_program_exec` module can be install to local Python installation using the following command executed in the repository root directory.

```
pip install . --user
```

## Usage

### On Robot Controller

Execute `MAIN` by selecting the `MAIN` program in the `Programs` tab and pressing the play button on top. You should see the play button turn green. Note: this step is **Extremely important!!!**. You need to make sure `MAIN` is runninng whenever you want to use the module

![](doc/figures/usage.png)

Further more, remeber to select the right `UT` (utool) and `UF` (uframe) you will be using.

![](doc/figures/ut_uf.png)

You can now run the python module. You can find the example code in `fanuc_motion_program_exec_client.py`

PLease consault [common_qa.md](https://github.com/eric565648/fanuc_motion_program_exec/blob/main/doc/common_qa.md) if you run the python module before you execute `MAIN`.

### Python Module

The class `TPMotionProgram` constains is used to build the sequence of motions. It has the following commands of interests:

* `moveJ(target,vel,vel_unit,zone)` - Move the robot to a specified joint waypoint. `target`: `jointtarget`. `vel`: integer. `vel_unit`: `%` or `msec`. `zone`: integer in [-1,100]. `-1` stands for `FINE` corner path (zone) and others stand for `CNT`.

* `moveL(target,vel,vel_unit,zone)` - Move the robot to the specified Cartesian target using linear interpolation. `target`: either `robtarget` or `jointtarget`. `vel`: integer in [1,2000]. `vel_unit`: `mmsec`. `zone`: integer in [-1,100]. `-1` stands for `FINE` corner path (zone) and others stand for `CNT`.

* `moveC(mid_target,end_target,vel,vel_unit,zone)` - Move the robot to the specified Cartesian target circularly using an intermediate waypoint. `mid_target`,`end_target`: either `robtarget` or `jointtarget`. `vel`: integer in [1,2000]. `vel_unit`: `mmsec`. `zone`: integer in [-1,100]. `-1` stands for `FINE` corner path (zone) and others stand for `CNT`.

The constructor for `TPMotionProgram` optionally takes `t_num` and `u_num` parameters (default `t_num`:2, `u_num`:2). This paramters tell the controller which tool and user frames to be used. You will need to setup your prefer tool/user frame as described in the setup stage.

The following types are defined as subclasses of `NamedTuple`

```
class pose(NamedTuple):
    trans: np.ndarray # [x,y,z]
    rot: np.ndarray # [w,p,r] deg

class confdata(NamedTuple):
    J5: str # F or N
    J3: str # U or D
    J1: str # T or B
    turn4: int # -1 0 1
    turn5: int # -1 0 1
    turn6: int # -1 0 1

class robtarget(NamedTuple):
    group: int
    uframe: int
    utool: int
    trans: np.ndarray # [x,y,z]
    rot: np.ndarray # [w,p,r] deg
    robconf: confdata # 
    extax: np.ndarray # shape=(6,)

class jointtarget(NamedTuple):
    group: int
    uframe: int
    utool: int
    robax: np.ndarray # shape=(6,)
    extax: np.ndarray # shape=(6,)
```

See the "FANUC Robot Controller series Operator's Manual (Basic Function)" for more details on these data types. Note that `trans`, `rot`, `extax` are implemented using numpy arrays or lists. 

Once the program is complete, it can be executed on the robot using `FANUCClient`. The constructor is by default.

```
client = FANUCClient(robot_ip='127.0.0.2')
```

The `robot_ip` should be adjusted as the real robot. Once the client is constructed, it can be used to execute program.

```
log_csv_bin = client.execute_motion_program(tp)
```

`log_csv_bin` will constain a CSV file in binary format. This can be saved to a binary file directly or converted to a strinf and used in Python. To conver to a string, use:
```
log_csv = log_csv_bin.decode('utf-8')
```

The CSV data has the following columns:

* `timestamp` -  The time of the row. This is time from the startup of the logger task in milli-seconds.
* `J1` - Joint 1 position in degrees
* `J2` - Joint 2 position in degrees
* `J3` - Joint 3 position in degrees
* `J4` - Joint 4 position in degrees
* `J5` - Joint 5 position in degrees
* `J6` - Joint 6 position in degrees

The first line of the CSV data contains column headers.

You can create several `TPMotionProgram` objects that contains different movement to be executed. However you only need one `FANUCClient` to connect to the robot controller.

## Example

```
tp = TPMotionProgram()

pt1 = robtarget(1,1,2,[1850,200,290],[-180,0,0],confdata('N','U','T',0,0,0),[0]*6)
pt2 = robtarget(1,1,2,[1850,200,589],[-180,0,0],confdata('N','U','T',0,0,0),[0]*6)
jt1 = jointtarget(1,1,2,[0,20,-10,0,-20,10],[0]*6)
pt3 = robtarget(1,1,2,[1850,250,400],[-180,0,0],confdata('N','U','T',0,0,0),[0]*6)

tp.moveL(pt1,50,'mmsec',100)
tp.moveL(pt2,50,'mmsec',-1)
tp.moveJ(jt1,100,'%',-1)
tp.moveL(pt2,50,'mmsec',100)
tp.moveC(pt3,pt1,50,'mmsec',-1)
tp.moveL(pt2,50,'mmsec',-1)

print(tp.get_tp())

client = FANUCClient()
res = client.execute_motion_program(tp)

with open("fanuc_log.csv","wb") as f:
    f.write(res)

print(res.decode('utf-8'))

tp = TPMotionProgram()
tp.moveL(pt1,50,'mmsec',100)
tp.moveL(pt2,50,'mmsec',-1)
client = FANUCClient()
res = client.execute_motion_program(tp)
```

Example log CSV data (truncated)
```
timestamp,J1,J2,J3,J4,J5,J6
 0,  18.6420,   8.3360, -35.3580, -34.7470,  32.8020,  25.2540

## Multi-Robot Example (with coordination)

Two robots with coordinated motion can be controlled using Robot Options `Multi-Group Motion (J601)` and `Coordinated Motion (J686)` See [multi_robot_coord_setup.md](https://github.com/eric565648/fanuc_motion_program_exec/blob/main/doc/multi_robot_coord_setup.md)) for setup instructions.

The two robot needs to have different `group_num` which are given in the `robtarget` or `jointtarget`. Execute `MAIN_MULT` (instead of `MAIN`) in RoboGuide before using the python module. The `execute_motion_program_multi` function of `FANUCClient` is used to send the two tp program to the controller for the two robots.

Note that in coordinated motion, there's actually only one TP program under the hood. Therefore, two `TPMotionProgram` motion your python script can only have the exact same motion primitives. 

Please consult FANUC manuals for more information.

```
tp_lead = TPMotionProgram()
tp_follow = TPMotionProgram()

# robtarget(motion group, uframe, utool, [x,y,z], [w,p,r], confdata, external axis)
# jointtarget(motion group, uframe, utool, [j1,j2,j3,j4,j5,j6], confdata, external axis)

# these are for follower robot, follower must be motion group 1
jt11 = jointtarget(1,1,2,[-49.7,4.3,-30.9,-20.9,-35.8,52.1],[0]*6)
pt12 = robtarget(1,1,2,[1383.1,-484.0,940.6],[171.5,-26.8,-9.8],confdata('N','U','T',0,0,0),[0]*6)
pt13 = robtarget(1,1,2,[1166.0,0,1430.0],[180.0,0,0],confdata('N','U','T',0,0,0),[0]*6)

# these are for leader robot, leader must be motion group 2
jt21 = jointtarget(2,1,2,[38.3,23.3,-10.7,45.7,-101.9,-48.3],[0]*6)
pt22 = robtarget(2,1,2,[994.0,924.9,1739.5],[163.1,1.5,-1.0],confdata('N','U','T',0,0,0),[0]*6)
pt23 = robtarget(2,1,2,[1620.0,0,1930.0],[180.0,0,0],confdata('N','U','T',0,0,0),[0]*6)

# two program must have the exact same motion primitives
tp_follow.moveJ(jt11,100,'%',-1) # moveJ does not support coordinated motion
tp_follow.moveL(pt12,500,'mmsec',100,'COORD') # add 'COORD' option
tp_follow.moveL(pt13,500,'mmsec',-1,'COORD')

tp_lead.moveJ(jt21,100,'%',-1)
tp_lead.moveL(pt22,500,'mmsec',100,'COORD')
tp_lead.moveL(pt23,500,'mmsec',-1,'COORD')

client = FANUCClient()
res = client.execute_motion_program_coord(tp_lead,tp_follow) # lead put in front

with open("fanuc_log.csv","wb") as f:
    f.write(res)

print(res.decode('utf-8'))
```

## Multi-Robot Example (without coordination)

Two robots can be controller using Robot Options `Multi-Group Motion (J601)`/ See [multi_robot_setup.md](https://github.com/eric565648/fanuc_motion_program_exec/blob/main/doc/multi_robot_setup.md) for setup instructions.

The two robot needs to have different `group_num` which are given in the `robtarget` or `jointtarget`. Execute `MAIN_MULT` (instead of `MAIN`) in RoboGuide before using the python module. The `execute_motion_program_multi` function of `FANUCClient` is used to send the two tp program to the controller for the two robots.

Unlike coordinated version, two robot can have totally different TP programs. There motion will then not be synchronized or coordinated in anyway. However, you will have more freedom on programming your robots.

```
tp1 = TPMotionProgram()
tp2 = TPMotionProgram()

# these are for motion group 1 (robot 1)
jt11 = jointtarget(1,1,2,[38.3,23.3,-10.7,45.7,-101.9,-48.3],[0]*6)
pt12 = robtarget(1,1,2,[994.0,924.9,1739.5],[163.1,1.5,-1.0],confdata('N','U','T',0,0,0),[0]*6)
pt13 = robtarget(1,1,2,[1620.0,0,1930.0],[180.0,0,0],confdata('N','U','T',0,0,0),[0]*6)

# these are for motion group 2 (robot 2)
jt21 = jointtarget(2,1,2,[-49.7,4.3,-30.9,-20.9,-35.8,52.1],[0]*6)
pt22 = robtarget(2,1,2,[1383.1,-484.0,940.6],[171.5,-26.8,-9.8],confdata('N','U','T',0,0,0),[0]*6)
pt23 = robtarget(2,1,2,[1166.0,0,1430.0],[180.0,0,0],confdata('N','U','T',0,0,0),[0]*6)

tp1.moveJ(jt11,100,'%',-1)
tp1.moveL(pt12,500,'mmsec',100)
tp1.moveL(pt13,500,'mmsec',-1)

tp2.moveJ(jt21,100,'%',-1)
tp2.moveL(pt22,500,'mmsec',100)
tp2.moveL(pt23,500,'mmsec',-1)

client = FANUCClient()
res = client.execute_motion_program_multi(tp1,tp2)

with open("fanuc_log.csv","wb") as f:
    f.write(res)

print(res.decode('utf-8'))
```

# Robot Raconteur Service

A Robot Raconteur service is available to allow a client to execute multi-move programs. The service
uses a standards track service definition `experimental.robotics.motion_program` that will provide interoperability
between multiple robot types. Due to the differences in the robot commands between controller implementations there 
may be slight differences in the commands between robots, but in general the commands are very similar.

When installing the module, include the `robotraconteur` option to get the required dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install fanuc-motion-program-exec[robotraconteur]
```

Start the service, specifying a robot info file:

```
fanuc-motion-program-exec-robotraconteur --mp-robot-info-file=config/FANUC_lrmate200id_motion_program_robot_default_config.yml
```

Optionally start using a module if the entrypoint does not work:

```
python -m fanuc_motion_program_exec_client.robotraconteur --mp-robot-info-file=config/FANUC_lrmate200id_motion_program_robot_default_config.yml
```

The following options are supported:

* `--mp-robot-info-file=` - The info file that specifies information about the robot
* `--mp-robot-ip=` - The connection IP address of the robot. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`
   for use with RoboGuide virtual controllers. Set `127.0.0.1` to the WAN IP address of the robot.
* `--mp-robot-username=` - The robot controller username. Defaults to "robot"
* `--mp-robot2-ip=` - Connection IP of second robot controller
* `--mp-robot2-username=` - Username for second robot controller

Examples for a single robot and multi-move robots are in the `examples/robotraconteur` directory. The motion
programs make heavy use of `varvalue` types to allow for flexibility in the motion program contents.
The Python type `RR.VarValue` is used to represent the `varvalue` type. See the Robot Raconteur Python documentation
for more inforamtion on how `RR.VarValue` works and why it is necessary.
